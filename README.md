# Computer-Vision :- Segmentation-and-Classification
This project addresses the successful application of convolutional neural networks of flower classification and segmentation. For classification, a custom CNN is built and trained from scratch to recognise the 17 different flower categories. For segmentation, a pretrained DeepLab v3+ model with a ResNet-18 backbone is used for distinguishing flowers from background. The classification achieved a high accuracy with validation performance improved though data augmentation, batch normalisation and dropout. The segmentation model is assessed using Mean Intersection Over-Union and Mean Boundary F1 score both of which showed strong performance. These results demonstrate that a custom CNN can also perform well with proper regularisation and transfer learning which is an effective strategy for achieving accurate pixel-wise predictions with limited labelled data
