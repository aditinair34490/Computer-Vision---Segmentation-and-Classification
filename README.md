# Computer-Vision :- Segmentation-and-Classification
This project explores computer vision techniques for recognizing and segmenting flowers using deep learning. It combines a custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classification with a pretrained DeepLab v3+ model for segmentation.
## Key Highlights

- Classification: A CNN trained from scratch to classify flowers into 17 categories.

- Segmentation: A DeepLab v3+ model with ResNet-18 backbone used to separate flowers from the background.

- Techniques: Data augmentation, batch normalization, and dropout improved accuracy and generalization.

- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), and Mean Boundary F1 Score.
